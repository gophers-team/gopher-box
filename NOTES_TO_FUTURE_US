Dear Future Us!

We've designed the device<->server api and started implementing it.
Device should work like this:
* it'll have a constant hearbeat process with periodic requests
* it'll make a request "how much tablets of each kind should I dispense?" when the user pushes the button "give me tablets"
* it'll report the dispense operation status

server should track devices by their ids and have a timetable for each device and for each tablet type

So, some work to do:
* implement server handling events, devices, users, notifications
* implement web interface for current statuses
* implement device logic
* implement device hardware
? maybe implement mobile applications

Btw, Volodya has taken the hardware with himself, so the last point is not 100% relevant
